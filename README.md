## Motivations
This app was built because there is a real lack of high-quality ad-free ways to prepare for the Life in the UK exam on Android. 
Most alternatives are either paid or ad-ridden, outdated & with hard to use UI/UX. They also have a distinct lack of variety of questions with most topping out at around 500.

Oh and also I wanted to dabble into native mobile development. This app is 100% built on Kotlin and has no AI slop.

## Current State
I am currently looking for testers. While I and my inner circle of friends and family have used the app to pass their exam successfully - Google does not find that satisfactory for their Play Store requirements.
