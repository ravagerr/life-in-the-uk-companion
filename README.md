# Life in The UK Companion
The Life in the UK Companion app is an ad-free, interactive and privacy respecting way to practice questions related to obtaining British Citizenship.

## Featured Modes

1. Exam - simulates exam conditions such as 45 minute timer, no answers revealed unless finished
2. Practice - reveals answers as you go through the questionnaire making learning much more efficient
3. Review - an assortment of questions that were previously incorrectly answered, lets the user focus on their mistakes

### Translations
The app also has the ability to provide **real-time** and **on-device** translations in more than 10 languages.

## Motivations
This app was built because there is a real lack of high-quality ad-free ways to prepare for the Life in the UK exam on Android. 

Most alternatives are either paid or ad-ridden, outdated & with hard to use UI/UX. They also have a distinct lack of variety of questions with most topping out at around 500.

Oh and also I wanted to dabble into native mobile development. This app is 100% built on Kotlin and has no AI slop.

## Current State
I am currently looking for testers. While I and my inner circle of friends and family have used the app to pass their exam successfully - Google does not find that satisfactory for their Play Store requirements.
